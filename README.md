# React

Here I'll be uploading what I learn about React.

## 01-react-intro

First introuction to react.

## 02-javascript-intro

Refresh of javascript, aswell as introduction to react projects.

## 03-counter-app

Simple counter app. It displays 3 buttons that either increase, reset or decrease the value shown.

In this lesson I've learnt about components, properties, hooks (useState)
and event handeling (click).

## 04-testing

In this lecture I've learnt the basics of how to use jest to create automated tests,
and enzyme to test components.

## 05-GifExpertApp

This is a simple example of how components make it easier to the dev to create fast app with
really low coding.

This app lets the user search categories (img categories). When he hits enter, 10 images matching the user input will be added to the web.

By developing this project, I've learnt the basics about hooks, custom hooks, helpers, and components comunication.

## 06-Hook-app

In this lesson I've learnt about the followin react hooks:

    * useState
    * useEffect
    * useRef
    * useLayout
    * useMemo
    * useCallback

The last folder (07-tarea-memo) is an exercise where useMemo and useCallback allow the up to work consuming less resources, since the components are rendered just once.


## TODOD APP 

This is a simple todo app, that allow the user to manage a todo list.

In this app, has been used the following React concepts:

    * useEffect
    * useReducer
    * useForm (custom hook)
    * dispatchers.


## 08-usercontext-app

For this proyect I've learned about contexts in react. 
As the teacher said, this is a good option to pass info between components 
for small projects, simple and effective.

In the nexts lesson I'll learn about Redux, which is the actual way to pass
info between components in bigger projects.
